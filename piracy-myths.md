# Piracy: Common Mythsâ€‹

```
My own comments are placed into the blocks like this one.

A lot of opinions have been said about the piracy and most of them are divided in two groups: "for" and "against" with respective reasoning. [This article](https://gbatemp.net/threads/piracy-common-myths.344858/) contains the most common myths about piracy which are relative to both sides.
```

* **Piracy is theft.**
This is by far the most common myth. Piracy is not theft because it does not cause any direct damage or loss to the other party (in fact, whether there's another party at all is sometimes up for debate). Theft, on the other hand, is a criminal act because in committing an act of theft, you deprive somebody of something. If I go and take an old lady's purse, *then due to my actions the old lady has been caused a loss*, her purse. However, when pirating, *nobody loses anything*. The pirater gains a *copy* of some digital item, while the person/entity who originally created that item *is completely unaffected by the act*.


```
Indeed, a person has two options in this context: to steal the material object and cause material damage respectively or not to steal. 
Relative to software, there are three choices: 1) to purchase it; 2) to download it from torrents; 3) not to install it at all. The last two options have the same outcome - a developer won't make a profit.
It's important to understand that if a person decides not to pay for software, he/she won't do it anyway and DRM won't help.

* **Piracy is not theft, so it's not illegal.**
Many people realize that piracy is not theft and doesn't cause a loss, so they assume that it's not illegal. That is false, in fact people [go to court](https://www.yahoo.com/news/court-wont-reduce-students-music-download-fine-144922490.html) and/or [get sued for piracy](https://www.yahoo.com/news/minnesota-woman-loses-music-downloading-appeal-184218469.html) all the time. [Civil law is still law](http://www.diffen.com/difference/Civil_Law_vs_Criminal_Law).


* **It's only illegal to upload, downloading is legal.**
This myth comes into being from people being taken to court for uploading. In reality [downloading is illegal too](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html#p2p), however the fees for uploading combined with downloading can be much bigger, setting a larger example, so that's generally what companies take people to court for, to make the biggest example out of them.

```
We can't encourage piracy - a lot of resources which are limited are spent on software development. And the most valuable one is time. Therefore downloader as well as uploader - both sides must take the responsibility.
```

* **Piracy causes job loss.**
Commonly-stated by large corporations, [but has no actual backing](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/04/us-government-finally-admits-most-piracy-estimates-are-bogus/). In fact [a government report (PDF)](http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10423.pdf) has looked into many commonly-cited numbers and reports for piracy and found them to have no actual backing, or to consist of outright lies in their references.

```
Manipulations and nothing more. Once again, who aren't going to buy the software, won't buy it anyway.
```

* **I'm just some guy on a forum, they'll never get me.**
Tell that to [GBATemp member kongsnutz](https://gbatemp.net/members/kongsnutz.131180/), who was [sued for $1,500,000 AUD](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2010/02/nintendo-wins-1-5m-aussie-piracy-settlement/).


* **That's just US law, copyright stuff doesn't apply to me in another country so I can pirate all I want.**
While I'm using US laws and regulations primarily since it's a main concern of this forum, this is another falsehood. [The WIPO/Berne Convention](http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/text.jsp?file_id=283698) is a worldwide agreement, if your country is in [the member list](http://www.wipo.int/members/en/) (there's over 100 countries there, so you most likely are) then your country recognizes the copyrights of other countries and has it's own laws in place to deal with violations. Look at the above example, which took place in Australia.


* **Piracy kills game systems.**
There is no correlation between systems that fail (or succeed) and piracy. Multiple systems have failed terribly without any piracy in their lifetime (Virtual Boy, N-Gage, CD-i), while other systems that had piracy enabled for the majority of their lifetime ended up being some of the top sellers of their generation (PS1, Wii, GBA, DS, etc.)

  This holds true for games as well, for example the PS3 was the last console of the 7th generation to be hacked (and patched the hacks quickly and recent models are unhackable), yet it sold many less games than the Wii, which was the first to be hacked (and does not patch hacks quickly, and still has hackable models being sold).

"Piracy is killing PC gaming!!!1"
Nope, that wasn't the point.
